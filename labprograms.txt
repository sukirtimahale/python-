1. Using input() function take one number from the user and using ternary operators
check whether the number is even or odd

#Taking input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#Using ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd
result = "Even" if number % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
# Printing the result
print(f"The number {number} is {result}.")


2. Using input function take two number and then swap the number

# Taking two inputs from the user
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
# Swapping the numbers
number1, number2 = number2, number1
# Printing the swapped numbers
print(f"After swapping: First number = {number1}, Second number = {number2}")


3.Write a Program to Convert Kilometers to Miles

# Taking input from the user
kilometers = float(input("Enter the distance in kilometers: "))
# 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles
miles = kilometers * 0.621371
# Printing the result
print(f"{kilometers} kilometers is equal to {miles} miles.")


4.Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Given values
Principal = 200  # Principal amount in Rs.
Rate = 5    # Rate of interest in percentage
Time = 5    # Time period in years
# Calculating Simple Interest
simple_interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
# Printing the result
print(f"The Simple Interest is Rs. {simple_interest}")


# Taking input from the user
P = float(input("Enter the principal amount (in Rs.): "))
R = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (in % per year): "))
T = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))
# Calculating Simple Interest
simple_interest = (P * R * T) / 100
# Printing the result
print(f"The Simple Interest is Rs. {simple_interest}")
